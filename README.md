# Title clickbait detection

new version using word embeding and LSTM
average validation accuracy is arround 75%

pretty promising model so far, taken into account the size of the dataset

I will not improve it until implementated into a browser extention, I will also spend time on learning tensorflow js so don't expect an update in the short term
